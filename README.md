In the realm of sports and competitive events, accurate timekeeping is crucial. Sports watches, particularly stopwatches, play a vital role in training and competitions, providing athletes and coaches with the precise measurements they need to evaluate performance. The increasing demand for reliable timing solutions has driven the development of advanced electronic systems
capable of managing time effectively. This project focuses on the design and implementation of a sports stopwatch system utilizing the Arty Z7 FPGA development kit.
